abstract = {DTI has demonstrated that Synthetic Aperture Sonar (SAS) can provide orders of magnitude improvement in cross-range resolution when compared to conventional sonar beamforming. Like Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), SAS processing requires coherence over multiple measurements, but has long been impractical due to the nature of the ocean environment. We have extended SAR processing ideas to accommodate the issues specific to the underwater environment, and have successfully synthesized apertures extending many thousands of wavelengths. We will present an overview of the theory of SAS processing, how it differs from SAR, and will show experimental results from SAS processing of sonar data.},

abstract = {This is a review paper that surveys past work in, and the recent status of, active synthetic aperture sonar (SAS). It covers the early historical development of SAS with its provenance in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and flows through into what work has been published in the open literature up to early 2007. The list of references is sufficiently complete to include most past and recent SAS publications in the open refereed literature.},
