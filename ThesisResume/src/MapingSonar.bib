abstract = {DTI has demonstrated that Synthetic Aperture Sonar (SAS) can provide orders of magnitude improvement in cross-range resolution when compared to conventional sonar beamforming. Like Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), SAS processing requires coherence over multiple measurements, but has long been impractical due to the nature of the ocean environment. We have extended SAR processing ideas to accommodate the issues specific to the underwater environment, and have successfully synthesized apertures extending many thousands of wavelengths. We will present an overview of the theory of SAS processing, how it differs from SAR, and will show experimental results from SAS processing of sonar data.},

@article{Moravec1985,
abstract = {We describe the use of multiple wide-angle sonar range measurements to map the surroundings of an autonomous mobile robot. A sonar range reading provides information concerning empty and occupied volumes in a cone (subtending 30 degrees in our case) in front of the sensor. The reading is modelled as probability profiles projected onto a rasterized map, where somewhere occupied and everywhere empty areas are represented. Range measurements from multiple points of view (taken from multiple sensors on the robot, and from the same sensors after robot moves) are systematically integrated in the map. Overlapping empty volumes re-inforce each other, and serve to condense the range of occupied volumes. The map definition improves as more readings are added. The final map shows regions probably occupied, probably unoccupied, and unknown areas. The method deals effectively with clutter, and can be used for motion planning and for extended landmark recognition. This system has been tested on the Neptune mobile robot at CMU.},

@misc{Dura2004,
abstract = {The seafloor is subject to attention and exploitation in many branches of science and technology. The acquisition of seabed information using AUVs equipped with a visual system composed of cameras and sonars is becoming more common. However, although most of these sensors, such as side-scan sonar, can generate a 2-D representation of the seafloor, 3-D information, which is crucial for environmental and geological studies, is only provided by a few sensors and often only at very low resolution. A linear shape-from-shading approach is presented, which is novel in the context of side-scan sonar images. This technique aims to recover the 3-D shape of textured seabeds from side-scan sonar images. For comparison purposes, an existing propagation shape from shading approach is also considered. Results showed that both techniques yield good results in terms of similarity and accuracy, although the linear shape-from-shading technique presented superior results when noise was present in the images, a condition which is very common with side-scan sonar images.},

Our technique is able to represent full 3D models including free and unknown areas. It is available as an open-source library to facilitate the development of 3D mapping systems. We also provide a detailed review of existing approaches to 3D modeling. Our approach was thoroughly evaluated using different real-world and simulated datasets. The results demonstrate that our approach is able to model the data probabilistically while, at the same time, keeping the memory requirement at a minimum.},

abstract = {In this paper, a new method for the estimation of seabed elevation maps from side-scan sonar images is presented. The side-scan image formation process is represented by a Lambertian diffuse model, which is then inverted by a multiresolution optimization procedure inspired by expectation-maximization to account for the characteristics of the imaged seafloor region. On convergence of the model, approximations for seabed reflectivity, side-scan beam pattern, and seabed altitude are obtained. The performance of the system is evaluated against a real structure of known dimensions. Reconstruction results for images acquired by different sonar sensors are presented. Applications to augmented reality for the simulation of targets in sonar imagery are also discussed.},

@article{Rosenblum1992,
abstract = {A high-resolution, very compact acoustic lens sonar was used to investigate how well small underwater objects can be reconstructed in 3D. The purpose was to develop an acoustic snapshot approaching photographic quality in turbid water where cameras and lens are ineffective. In-water experiments have provided data from an 8-by-8 array of acoustical beams with 1.5 degree conical resolution. Algorithms have been developed to interpolate the conical grid onto a grid. Once gridded, a volume rendering algorithm was applied to produce a full 3D rendering of the object. The sensitivity of this process to different gridding algorithms is evaluated. It is shown that objects can be quantified in size quite precisely. The degree to which shape can be extracted and small details made visible is discussed. The authors also consider how well the reconstruction can be improved by using multiple passes over the object. Registration algorithms are presented, and it is shown that the alignment process can be done with enough accuracy to improve the image and provide greater detail about the object},

abstract = {This paper describes a method to estimate the three-dimensional aspects of underwater objects using a sequence of sonar images. The data are recorded by a sector scanning sonar, carried by an underwater vehicle which follows a circular track around the object. The sonar images are segmented into three kinds of regions : echo, shadow and background. The echo information corresponds to the signal back-scattered by the object while the shadow is due to the absence of back-scattering from behind the object. The remaining information composes the background. The reconstruction scheme processes the echo and shadow information separately. A two-dimensional elevation map is estimated from the shadow information and a two-dimensional reflection map is computed from the echoes. The final reconstruction merges these two maps},
