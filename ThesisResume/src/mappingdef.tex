The meaning of mapping can be interpreted in different ways, depending on the
context. Taking what they all have in common, it is possible to generically
define mapping as being the processing of received environmental data to
characterize the surroundings. In this characterization is where the difference
lays, how the environs are going to be represented is dependent on the
application.

On a SLAM, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping, system there is no intrinsic
need for a human readable map. In such a system, it may be more interesting to
store the map information only through its most representative features, if that
is what matters for the localization procedure.

On the other hand, if the map is to be seen by a human it should store more
information about the environment, so that it can be displayed as a usual map,
3D or 2D depending on the case. This representation also guides how the data
could be stored, e.g. if it wants to show a surface, it can be stored as a
elevation map, or if one wants to see a 3D object it can be stored as a point
cloud.
